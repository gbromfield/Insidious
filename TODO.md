# TODOs

1. allow ctrl-d to close the ssh session.
2. <s>make sure threads cleaned up on session removal.</s>
3. move the SSH key file to the executable jar file.
4. allow more than one recording to be specified so that constants like act-user and rtrv-hdr don't need to be in the recording everytime.
